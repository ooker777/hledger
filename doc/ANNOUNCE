hledger is free, robust, friendly, multicurrency, double-entry,
plain text accounting software for unix, mac, windows, and the web.

Written in Haskell for reliability, it is built around human-readable,
version-controllable plain text files. It is inspired by and largely
compatible with Ledger CLI, and convertible to and from Beancount.
