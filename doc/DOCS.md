## Four kinds of documentation

<div style="margin:1em 2em; font-style:italic;">
"There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good
software documentation: there isnâ€™t one thing called documentation,
there are four. They are: tutorials, how-to guides, explanation and
technical reference. They represent four different purposes or
functions, and require four different approaches to their creation."

## hledger's documentation structure

2019: out of date, needs update.

Project documentation lives in a number of places:

- `site/*.md` is the hledger.org website content, which is generated with hakyll[-std] and pandoc
- haddock documentation in the code appears on Hackage
- short blurbs: cabal files, module headers, HCAR, GSOC project, ..
- `doc/notes.org` has some old developer notes
- developer reports (profiles, benchmarks, coverage..) in doc/profs, sometimes published at hledger.org/profs
- https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/tree/master/doc


site/ is now a symlink to the separate hledger_site repo.

See also Shake.hs.

hledger doc files can be divided into several groups: 

1. Project admin/dev notes not published on the website.
   These are kept in this directory (doc/). They include: 
   ``` 
   doc/finance/      project finances
   doc/hcar/         Haskell Community and Activities Report entries
   doc/lib.m4        common macros used in package manuals
   doc/manpage.*     misc. templates for rendering package manuals
   doc/mockups/      exploratory developer mockups   
   doc/profs/        a place for long-term profiling/performance data
   ```
2. Project doc files required to be in the top directory:
   ```
   README.md         the main project readme, displayed on github
   LICENSE           the default project license
   ```
3. Code/API docs in haskell source files as haddock comments:
   ```
   hledger*/**/*.hs  haddock module and function docs in most source files
   ```
4. Per-package descriptions, readmes, changelogs, and reference manuals.
   These are in the respective package directories:
   ```
   hledger*/package.yaml    source for package metadata (description, etc.)
   hledger*/README          package readme, displayed on hackage
   hledger*/CHANGES         package changelog, displayed on hackage
   hledger*/hledger*.m4.md  package manual source file(s)
   ```
5. The project website and additional docs - home page, FAQ, tutorials, 
   how-tos, developer guide, etc. These are in the site directory:
   ```
   site/             hledger.org website content, templates, assets
   ```

## Workflows

Last updated: 2025-09
<!-- keep synced with Justfile, Shake.hs -->

### Update manuals' content

Updates to the manuals' content are welcome and encouraged!
They can be committed together with related code changes, or separately.

Note the manuals have (a) source files and (b) files generated from these by scripts.
Don't edit the generated files, such as:
- `hledger/hledger.md` or `hledger-ui/hledger-ui.md` in the hledger repo
- `site/src/1.50/hledger*.md` or `site/src/dev/hledger*.md` in the hledger_site repo

Instead, edit the source files, in the hledger repo's master branch. Usually that means:
- `hledger/hledger.m4.md` or `hledger/Hledger/Cli/Commands/*.md` for the hledger manual
- `hledger-ui/hledger-ui.m4.md` for the hledger-ui manual
- `hledger-web/hledger-web.m4.md` for the hledger-web manual.

If you click "edit this page" on a recent release manual on the website, you'll see all of its source files listed.

### Compile the Shake script

`Shake.hs` automates some doc maintenance tasks (complementing `Justfile)`.
If you use it, it's best to compile it first: in the hledger repo, run:
```
$ ./Shake.hs
```

### Update manuals' generated files

Contributors don't need to do this; usually it's done periodically by the maintainer.
It requires unix tools such as m4, makeinfo and pandoc.

In the hledger repo: first, set current year and month for the man pages:
```
$ just mandates
```

Then regenerate the text, man, info, and markdown manuals in hledger*/ from their source files:

```
$ ./Shake manuals
```

To also commit the generated files, run it with -c:

```
$ ./Shake manuals -c
```

### Update hledger binaries with latest manuals included

The next build of the hledger executables will embed the latest text, man and info manuals from hledger*/. Eg:

```
$ stack build
```

### Update dev manuals on the website

When updates to the generated manuals land in the master branch of the hledger repo on github,
the latest (dev) manuals on hledger.org will update automatically.

(The website manuals are rendered from `site/src/VERSION/*.md` in the hledger_site repo,
which are symlinked copies of `hledger/hledger.md`, `hledger-ui/hledger-ui.md` and `hledger-web/hledger-web.md` in the hledger repo.)

### Update release manuals on the website

Contributors can do this, but doing it the right way is a little complicated; you can also ask the maintainer to do it.

The release manuals on the website are rendered from `site/src/1.50/*.md`, `site/src/1.43/*.md`, etc.
In the hledger repo, with the hledger_site repo symlinked as `./site`:

For each major release REL that needs updating,

1. Cherry pick the manuals' content updates for REL (not generated files updates) from `master` to `REL-branch`
2. In master, run `just site-manuals-snapshot REL` to update the release manuals in the site repo.

When these commits land in the hledger_site repo on github,
the release manuals on hledger.org will update automatically.

They occasionally generate a lot of noise in the commit log, and I think it's a good to keep that out of the code history. The website (home and other pages, site design, site infrastructure) generates similar commit storms and is somewhat independent of code, so it goes in the soft docs repo too.
