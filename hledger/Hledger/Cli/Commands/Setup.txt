setup

Check the status of the hledger installation.

Flags:
no command-specific flags

setup tests your hledger installation and prints a list of results,
sometimes with helpful hints. This is a good first command to run after
installing hledger. Also after upgrading, or when something's not
working, or just when you want a reminder of where things are.

It makes one network request to detect the latest hledger release
version. It's ok if this fails or times out. It will use ANSI color by
default, unless disabled by NO_COLOR or --color=n. It does not use a
pager or a config file.

It expects that the hledger version you are running is installed in your
PATH. If not, it will stop until you have done that (to keep things
simple).

Example:

$ hledger setup
